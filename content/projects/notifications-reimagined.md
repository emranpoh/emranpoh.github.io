## Overview

As part of CS4249 (Phenomena and Theories of Human-Computer Interaction), our team conducted research on mobile notification systems and proposed a reimagined approach to how notifications are delivered and managed on mobile devices.

## Research Focus

- User behavior patterns with mobile notifications
- Cognitive load and interruption costs
- Context-aware notification delivery
- Priority-based notification management

## Methodology

1. Literature Review
2. User Research
   - Surveys
   - User interviews
   - Behavioral observation
3. Prototype Development
4. User Testing

## Key Findings

- Impact of notifications on productivity
- User preferences for notification timing
- Context-sensitivity in notification delivery
- Priority management strategies

## Proposed Solution

Our reimagined notification system introduced:
- Context-aware delivery timing
- Smart grouping of notifications
- Priority-based filtering
- Customizable notification modes
