## Overview

In this talk, I explore the profound themes of emptiness, isolation, death, and hope through Hideo Kojima's masterpiece, Death Stranding. The presentation draws parallels between the game's post-apocalyptic world and our contemporary experiences with isolation and human connection.

## Key Themes

- The significance of human connection in an increasingly isolated world
- Death Stranding's metaphorical representation of modern social barriers
- How digital connections can bridge physical isolation
- The role of hope in rebuilding communities

## Impact

This talk was presented at NUS HCI Lab, sparking discussions about:
- The role of video games in understanding social phenomena
- How digital experiences reflect and influence real-world human connections
- The intersection of game design and social commentary
