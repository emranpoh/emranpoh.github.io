## Abstract

This paper explores the use of mixed reality for engineering design review, specifically focusing on finite element analysis. We present a novel approach to visualizing and interacting with FEA results in mixed reality environments.

## Introduction

Engineering design review is a critical process that often involves complex data visualization and analysis. This paper examines how mixed reality can enhance this process by providing intuitive ways to interact with finite element analysis results.

## Methodology

Our research combines user-centered design methods with technical implementation to develop and evaluate a mixed reality system for engineering design review. We conducted user studies with engineering professionals to assess the effectiveness of our approach.

## Results

Our findings demonstrate that mixed reality can significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of engineering design review. We present several key insights and design recommendations for mixed reality applications in engineering contexts.

## Discussion

The implications of our research extend beyond engineering design review. We discuss broader applications of mixed reality in professional contexts and the future of human-computer interaction in technical domains.

## Conclusion

Mixed reality shows great promise for enhancing engineering design review processes. Our research provides a foundation for future work in this area and highlights the potential of mixed reality in professional applications.
