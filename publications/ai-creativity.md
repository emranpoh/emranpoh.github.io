## Abstract

This paper explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and human creativity, examining how AI systems can augment and enhance human creative processes. We present a framework for understanding AI-assisted creativity and discuss its implications for design and research.

## Introduction

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has opened new possibilities for creative expression and innovation. This paper examines how AI systems can be designed to support and enhance human creativity, rather than replace it.

## Methodology

Our research combines qualitative and quantitative methods to understand how AI systems can best support human creativity. We conducted user studies with creative professionals and developed a framework for AI-assisted creativity.

## Results

Our findings suggest that AI systems can effectively augment human creativity when designed with the right balance of automation and human control. We present several key insights and design recommendations.

## Discussion

The implications of our research extend beyond the immediate context of AI-assisted creativity. We discuss broader implications for human-AI interaction and the future of creative work.

## Conclusion

AI systems have the potential to significantly enhance human creativity, but careful design is required to ensure they support rather than replace human creative processes.
