An intuitive ability to realistically visualize and manipulate a 3D model of an engineering assembly prior to physical prototyping is key to an efficient design process. The current project aims to assess the feasibility of using an internally developed mixed reality (MR) application to improve design visualization through holographic representation of engineering components. In this way, design engineers may through the design process more efficiently and effectively.
