Mixed Reality (MR) provides a unique environment for engineers to visualize a virtual CAD model's structural characteristics within a real physical environment. Existing implementations have explored conducting structural design reviews in virtual environments. However, more can be done to explore conducting virtual structural reviews on assemblies using MR. A MR-based application is developed, for engineers to conduct structural design reviews with support for complete assemblies and visualizing adjacent structural behaviors, using Finite Element Analysis (FEA). A preliminary evaluation study conducted an engineering design review with participants in either MR or on a conventional desktop computer, measuring the usability, sense of flow, and workload. The pilot study results suggest that MR is an intuitive platform with higher absorption of activity and flow experience, despite incurring a higher physical demand than the desktop environment. Based on the findings, we discuss the current potential and challenges faced when conducting design reviews within a MR environment, suggest improvements that can be made when designing MR-based engineering tools, and discuss the significant benefits that MR can offer over traditional desktop monitor based applications.
