## Abstract

This paper explores how to support artefact awareness in partially-replicated workspaces, where users collaborate across physical and virtual environments. We present a framework for understanding and enhancing awareness of shared artefacts in mixed reality settings.

## Introduction

As mixed reality technologies become more prevalent, understanding how to support collaboration across physical and virtual spaces becomes increasingly important. This paper focuses on the challenge of maintaining awareness of shared artefacts in partially-replicated workspaces.

## Methodology

Our research combines qualitative and quantitative methods to understand how users maintain awareness of shared artefacts in mixed reality environments. We conducted user studies with pairs of participants working in partially-replicated workspaces.

## Results

Our findings suggest that current mixed reality systems often fail to adequately support artefact awareness. We present several key insights and design recommendations for improving awareness in partially-replicated workspaces.

## Discussion

The implications of our research extend beyond the immediate context of mixed reality collaboration. We discuss broader implications for human-computer interaction and the future of collaborative work.

## Conclusion

Supporting artefact awareness in partially-replicated workspaces requires careful consideration of both technical and social factors. Our research provides a foundation for future work in this area.
