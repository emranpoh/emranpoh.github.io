Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is an integral process in manufacturing design, providing assurance of quality and structural integrity of a manufactured item. FEA involves conducting rigorous stress simulations on a designed model to study its structural behaviour when under specific loading scenarios. Current FEA tools involve viewing and manipulating the 3D model displayed on a monitor screen. A Mixed Reality (MR) user interface allowing for direct manipulation and specification of loading scenarios on a designed model was developed, thus enabling design engineers to find new ways of interacting and visualising FEA results for analysis and thus reducing unnecessary prototyping costs. Three gesture interfaces were developed to allow application of load parameters on a surface of a model, namely: Point-Apply, Point-Hold, and Point-Drag. A pilot evaluation was conducted to study the suitability of each as an interface designed for engineers. Results suggest that Point-Hold is empirically the most usable interface compared to the other interfaces.
