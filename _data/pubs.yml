The proposed VR environment allows participants to walk across multiple road lanes, and experience and interact with high fidelity simulated traffic scenarios, including signalized and unsignalized intersections at 1:1 scale, with vehicular traffic making turns, and providing audio feedback. This simulation can be used for conducting user studies to test AV eHMIs or behavior interventions with participants.},\nbooktitle = {Adjunct Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Automotive User Interfaces and Interactive Vehicular Applications},\npages = {300‚Äì303},\nnumpages = {4},\nkeywords = {autonomous vehicles, external human machine interface, pedestrian crossing, virtual reality},\nlocation = {Ingolstadt, Germany},\nseries = {AutomotiveUI '23 Adjunct}\n}"

Existing work has focused on conducting DFMA within virtual environments to reduce manufacturing costs, but users are less able to relate and compare physical characteristics of a virtual component with real physical objects. Therefore, a Mixed Reality (MR) application is developed for engineers to visualise and manipulate assembly parts virtually, conduct and plan out an assembly within its intended physical environment. Two pilot evaluations were conducted with both engineering professionals and non-engineers to assess effectiveness of the software for assembly planning. Usability results suggest that the application is overall usable (M=56.1, SD=7.89), and participants felt a sense of involvement in the activity (M=13.1, SD=3.3). Engineering professionals see the application as a useful and cost-effective tool for optimising their mechanical assembly designs.\",\nisbn=\"978-3-031-19679-9\"\n}"

FEA involves conducting rigorous stress simulations on a designed model to study its structural behaviour when under specific loading scenarios. Current FEA tools involve viewing and manipulating the 3D model displayed on a monitor screen. A Mixed Reality (MR) user interface allowing for direct manipulation and specification of loading scenarios on a designed model was developed, thus enabling design engineers to find new ways of interacting and visualising FEA results for analysis and thus reducing unnecessary prototyping costs. Three gesture interfaces were developed to allow application of load parameters on a surface of a model, namely: Point-Apply, Point-Hold, and Point-Drag. A pilot evaluation was conducted to study the suitability of each as an interface designed for engineers. Results suggest that Point-Hold is empirically the most usable interface compared to the other interfaces.},\nbooktitle = {Social Computing and Social Media: Experience Design and Social Network Analysis        : 13th International Conference, SCSM 2021, Held as Part of the 23rd HCI International Conference, HCII 2021, Virtual Event, July 24‚Äì29, 2021, Proceedings, Part  I},\npages = {470‚Äì483},\nnumpages = {14},\nkeywords = {Finite Element Analysis, Mixed reality, Gesture, 3D user interface, Digital twin}\n}"
