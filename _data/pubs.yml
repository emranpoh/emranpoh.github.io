Prior work focused on VR simulations that re-create less complex scenarios for the evaluation of different autonomous vehicle (AV) behavior and external human-machine interfaces (eHMIs). The proposed VR environment allows participants to walk across multiple road lanes, and experience and interact with high fidelity simulated traffic scenarios, including signalized and unsignalized intersections at 1:1 scale, with vehicular traffic making turns, and providing audio feedback. This simulation can be used for conducting user studies to test AV eHMIs or behavior interventions with participants.},\nbooktitle = {Adjunct Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Automotive User Interfaces and Interactive Vehicular Applications},\npages = {300–303},\nnumpages = {4},\nkeywords = {autonomous vehicles, external human machine interface, pedestrian crossing, virtual reality},\nlocation = {Ingolstadt, Germany},\nseries = {AutomotiveUI '23 Adjunct}\n}"
