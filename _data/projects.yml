  description: "Be-Longing is a site-specific, augmented reality (AR) experiential artwork on UTown Green that invites you to slow down and enjoy life as a community. This interactive experience lets participants 'light' AR sparklers using their mobile phones. As more AR sparklers are lighted, more AR balloons are floated in the sky ‚Äì personifying the beauty of humanity, lifting and supporting each other in times of uncertainty."
