  description: "Be-Longing is a site-specific, augmented reality (AR) experiential artwork on UTown Green that invites you to slow down and enjoy life as a community. This interactive experience lets participants 'light' AR sparklers using their mobile phones. As more AR sparklers are lighted, more AR balloons are floated in the sky – personifying the beauty of humanity, lifting and supporting each other in times of uncertainty."
